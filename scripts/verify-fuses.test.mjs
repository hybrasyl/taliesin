// The cheap half of HTOO-167, and it covers a different failure from the
// script it tests.
//
// `verify-fuses.mjs` only ever runs against a packaged artifact, which exists
// on a tag and nowhere else. This file runs on every commit and asserts that
// electron-builder.yml still asks for the fuses in the first place — so
// deleting or editing the block reds a PR instead of reaching a release. Match
// a check's frequency to what it can see: packaging on every PR to buy the
// artifact check would cost minutes for what this buys at a fraction of it.
//
// It also pins the copy of @electron/fuses' internal constants that the script
// carries. A copy of someone else's file rots silently, and the rot here is
// nastier than most: a moved sentinel makes the verifier find NOTHING rather
// than find something wrong.
