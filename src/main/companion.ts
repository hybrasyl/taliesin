/**
 * Finding and launching Creidhne, Taliesin's companion application.
 *
 * HTOO-292. The previous version was Windows-shaped in three ways at once: the
 * renderer handed main an executable path, the settings picker filtered for
 * `exe`, and the launch was a bare `spawn`. So the setting could not even be
 * *populated* on macOS or Linux, where the companion is a `.app` bundle or an
 * AppImage or a desktop entry rather than a directly-spawnable file.
 *
 * **The renderer now names an identity, never a path.** `spawn` has a far larger
 * blast radius than a file read, so what may be launched is decided here, from
 * sources this process controls. The old allowlist — permit exactly the
 * configured string — was the right instinct and survives as the `manual`
 * branch; what it lacked was any notion of a target that is not a binary.
 *
 * **Every platform probe is injected.** Registry queries, `.desktop` lookups and
 * Applications-folder scans cannot run in a unit test, and a resolver whose
 * precedence rules are only exercised on the author's own machine is a resolver
 * with one tested path. `CompanionProbe` is the seam; `nodeProbe()` is the real
 * one.
