/**
 * Remote-session detection, and the mitigation that hangs off it.
 *
 * A Remote Desktop session has no GPU. Windows attaches the Microsoft Remote
 * Display Adapter, so Chromium rasterises in software while still paying for GPU
 * compositing, and every repaint is then captured and encoded by RDP itself.
 * Taliesin is frameless, so window dragging goes through Chromium's app-region
 * hit testing rather than a native title bar — the more expensive path under
 * exactly these conditions. Reported against epona over RDP, 2026-08-07
 * (HTOO-325); filed against the template because every app cut from it inherits
 * the gap.
 *
 * **Detection rather than a setting, and that is the card's decision rather than
 * a preference.** `app.disableHardwareAcceleration()` must run before the `ready`
 * event; Taliesin loads settings through `fs.promises` with no synchronous path,
 * so a persisted toggle would need a new sync read of `settings.json` at module
 * load, racing `migrateSettingsFromRoaming`. Detecting the environment costs no
 * schema change, no store action, no UI and no migration ordering hazard. A UI
 * toggle is explicitly not wanted: the app should adapt rather than ask.
 *
 * **Pure, and it reads its arguments rather than `process`.** The call site in
 * `index.ts` supplies them, so every test case is a plain function call with no
 * `process.env` mutation. The shape is epona's (`src/shared/remoteSession.js`),
 * which balor reached independently — both authors refused the inline sketch in
 * the card body, which is the strongest argument there is for this form.
 *
 * `src/main/`, not `src/shared/`: the renderer never needs this answer, and
 * Taliesin's `src/shared/` is electron-free predicates the vitest node project
 * and main both use.

/**
 * Is this process running in a Remote Desktop session?
 *
 * Two signals, in priority order, and the ordering is the whole point.
 *
 * **`systemRemoteSession` is `GetSystemMetrics(SM_REMOTESESSION)`** — a live
 * query that cannot go stale — and it is believed in **both** directions when
 * present. `null` means "no opinion", which falls through to the environment
 * variable rather than being read as "not remote".
 *
 * **`sessionName` is `%SESSIONNAME%`, and it LIES after a reconnect.** Windows
 * writes it at logon and never revises it, so RDP-ing into a machine that already
 * has your session open at the console — which *reconnects* that session rather
 * than creating a new one — leaves every process reporting `Console` over RDP.
 * Measured by epona on a test machine: `SESSIONNAME=Console` with `query session`
 * showing `rdp-tcp#0 Active`. `CLIENTNAME` goes stale identically and is no help.
 * That is what happens to anyone who leaves a machine logged in and later connects
 * to it remotely, so it is the common case rather than a corner, and it made the
 * whole adaptation inert for exactly the users it was written for.
 *
 * **Nothing supplies `systemRemoteSession` in Taliesin today, and that is a
 * deliberate stop rather than an oversight.** Epona reads it through `da-win32`,
 * which it already loads on Windows for the Legacy tab — so there it adds a load
 * rather than a dependency. Taliesin has no native module at all, and taking this
 * signal would mean adding one to the pre-`ready` boot path for a single integer.
 * The parameter is here, and tested, so wiring a native probe later is a change at
 * the call site rather than a change to the rule. Until then
 * `TALIESIN_DISABLE_GPU=1` is the answer for a user whose session reconnects,
 * which is a large part of why the override exists.
 *
 * Neither signal detects Parsec, Sunshine, VNC or other non-RDP remote tools, and
 * `SESSIONNAME` is a Windows variable, so xrdp, X2Go and Wayland-remote get
 * nothing.

 * Injected into the main window when software rendering is in force.
 *
 * Four of Taliesin's six themes put `backdropFilter: blur(2px)` on
 * `MuiPaper.root` — chadul, danaan, grinneal and hybrasyl — which backs Card,
 * Dialog, Accordion and Menu. A blur makes Chromium read back everything behind
 * the surface and blur it on every repaint, including every frame of a drag. With
 * a GPU that is nearly free; under software compositing it is not. Disabling the
 * GPU and leaving the blur in place would be half a fix — balor shipped exactly
 * that and had to come back for it (HTOO-327).
 *
 * **Keyed to the DECISION, not to detection.** `TALIESIN_DISABLE_GPU=1` on a local
 * machine puts compositing on the CPU just as surely as RDP does, and the blur is
 * expensive for that reason rather than because the session is remote. Keying it
 * to detection would make the repro flag reproduce only half the condition it
 * exists to reproduce.
 *
 * **Narrower than epona's, and measured rather than copied.** Epona also kills
 * `text-shadow` and forces antialiased smoothing, because its themes carry text
 * shadows widely. Taliesin's six themes declare none — the only `textShadow` in
 * the app is one line on the title-bar title, already dropped on the two corporate
 * themes. One element's shadow is not a repaint cost worth a global `!important`,
 * and a rule that changes how the app looks should earn it.
 *
 * A runtime injection rather than a theme edit: it reverts by simply not being
 * injected, and the themes stay one description of how the app looks. `dom-ready`
 * fires before first paint, so there is no flash of the blurred style.
 *
 * **Unconditional across themes on purpose.** It is a no-op where there is no
 * blur, which is what makes a mid-session theme switch need no second decision —
 * and a rule with no exceptions cannot be applied to the wrong half of a six-theme
 * set by a later author adding a seventh.
