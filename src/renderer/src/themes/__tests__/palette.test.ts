 * Palette invariants, pinned because a comment was not enough once already.
 *
 * The Hybrasyl theme shipped with `primary.main` set to the same value as
 * `background.default` (`#0d182f`). Every control that signals its active state
 * through `color="primary"` therefore painted itself the colour of the page
 * behind it, and the affordance INVERTED: a filled Chip takes `primary.main` as
 * its background while an unselected one keeps MUI's default grey, so the
 * selected chip was the one that disappeared.
 *
 * Two places in the Map Maker had already worked around it locally with
 * `Mui-selected` overrides — the tell that this had been hit before and patched
 * at the leaves rather than at the root. Those are gone; this is the root.
 *
 * The bug is that two palette entries held one colour and nothing prevented it,
 * so the test walks EVERY theme rather than the one that was broken. See
 * HTOO-341.
